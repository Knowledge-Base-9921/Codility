# Prime and Composite Numbers / Primality Test

'''
The primality test of n can be performed in an analogous way to counting the divisors. If we
find a number between 2 and n âˆ’ 1 that divides n then n is a composite number. Otherwise,
n is a prime number.

NOTE: We assume that 1 is neither a prime nor a composite number, so the above algorithm works
only for n <= 2.
