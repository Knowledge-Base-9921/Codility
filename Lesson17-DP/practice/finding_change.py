# Dynamic Programming / Finding Change

'''
Consider n denominations, 0 < c0 <= c1 <= . . . <= cnâˆ’1. The algorithm processes the respective
denominations and calculates the minimum number of coins needed to pay every amount
from 0 to k. When considering each successive denomination, we use the previously calculated
results for the smaller amounts.
